Accepted syntax in Regal


All Unicode whitespace characters besides the newline character are ignored between tokens.

Most tokens are separated by whitespace. No token can contain whitespace characters.

All tokens are case-sensitive. There are no capital letters in keywords.



Declarative tokens:

    Variable/function labels: Variable/function labels must start with a letter or '_' followed by 
    any number of alphanumeric characters or '_'.

    'let': Denotes the assignment of a new variable or function. (e.g. 'let x = 3')

    'now': Denotes the reassigment/retyping of an existing variable or function. (e.g. 'now x = true')

    'if': Keyword that precedes a boolean and executes a block of code based on that boolean. //////////////////////////

    '=': Assigns the given variable/function label to the given expression.


Value tokens:

    Integers: Whole numbers that represent their value. (e.g. 3)

    'true': The boolean value True.

    'false': The boolean value False.


Mathematical tokens:

    Integers: Signed whole numbers. Negative integers cannot have whitespace between 
    the '-' and number characters.

    '**': Two asterisks denote an exponential relationship between numbers. (e.g. '2**3' is 2 to the 3rd power)

    '+': Adds two numbers.

    '-': Subtracts two numbers.

    '*': Multiplies two numbers.

    '/': Divides two numbers and truncates any decimal digits.

    '>': Compares two values, returning true if the left value is "larger" than the right value.

    '<': Compares two values, returning true if the left value is "smaller" than the right value.

    '=': Compares two values for equality.

    '(': Denotes expression groupings to assign an order of operations to expressions.

    ')': Closes expression groupings.


Special tokens:

    'nothing': The equivalent of 'NULL', 'nil', or '()' in other languages.

    '\n': The newline character separates statements.
