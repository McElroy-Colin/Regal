# Regal V0.4

Compiler source code in progress.

Regal is a work-in-progress non-functional programming language developed by Colin McElroy. Currently, the language is unfinished with progress on compiler source code in the src/src_langdef directory. Regal is intended to have variable declaration, function declaration, static type-checking, implicit typing, optimized evaluation, and more. Updates will be posted here in the dev branch as progress continues.

Note: C++17 or later is required for execution of any compiler code.

V0.4 Progress:
 - Regal playground! 
   The program ./playground/playground.cpp can be used to generate a simple text environment to write Regal code.

 - Functioning lexer, parser, and optimizer/executor of code for variable declaration with mathematical expressions.
 - Type checking is WIP, and static optimization will continue to expand to string variables.
